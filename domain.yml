  utter_kanban:
  - text: Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process.
      Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing
      through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks
      in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at
      an optimal speed or throughput.
